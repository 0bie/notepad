  "slug": "successful-shipping",
  "text": "Entrepreneurs across the globe are taking advantage of a new niche of ecommerce known as ‘free plus shipping’. The free plus shipping method can be very lucrative for businesses, and it’s a great way to sell high-quality merchandise to your customers at an affordable price point. We’ve created this article to guide you through everything that you’ll need to know about free plus shipping businesses. At the end of this article you’ll be well equipped to start your own ecommerce store using the free plus shipping business method, and you’ll be ready to start generating profit today. A free plus shipping business is an ecommerce store which sells products for $0.00, and only charges customers the shipping fees. You may be asking yourself: ‘Wait, how can you make any money from this business model?’ Ecommerce entrepreneurs who are running their store with a free plus shipping business model generate profit by inflating their shipping prices. This is done to cover the cost of the product which they’re selling. If a regular ecommerce store is going to sell a product for $5, they will likely add an additional $2.50 for shipping. On the other hand, a free plus shipping store will simply sell the product for free, but increase the shipping fees to $7.50. This means that both ecommerce businesses generated $7.50 in revenue. As you can see, the free plus shipping method is a clever tactic which ecommerce entrepreneurs can use to add instant appeal to their products, and let’s be honest, who doesn’t like free stuff?",

Unfortunately, too much success too quickly can sometimes raise red flags. Oberlo processes hundreds of thousands of orders per day. The issue in this article happens to a rare few. Hopefully, by reading this, you can take the right steps to ensure that this issue doesn’t happen to you or if it does, you’re equipped with the knowledge to resolve it quickly. In this article, you’ll learn why AliExpress sometimes closes orders, how to resolve the issue quickly and how to maintain a positive relationship with your customers during it. The main reason why AliExpress closes orders is for fraudulent activity. With Oberlo, people have the potential to make a lot of profit quickly. If you start making $10,000 a day, AliExpress may be suspicious of your account. They have a responsibility to ensure that they aren’t losing money so they’ll close your orders as an extra precaution. Your account can also appear as fraudulent to AliExpress as you’ll regularly be ordering from the same location and shipping internationally. It may appear as if the credit card has been stolen. Another reason why they may block orders would be if your credit card fails. A credit card can fail when you process too many orders at once for the first time or have insufficient funds which cause your bank to freeze the card. Make sure that you have enough funds on your credit card to allow the payment through."

  "text": "Every day entrepreneurs across the world run into the same problem: they know that they want to start their own business, but they don’t know what to sell. They’re well aware that choosing products is an important process, so they’re constantly looking for “the next big thing” – a product that will set them apart from their competition. Sound familiar? If it does, we’ve got something to tell you: you don’t need to sell trending products to find success in ecommerce. And that’s exactly why we’ve created this article – we’ve seen many entrepreneurs over the years focus their energy into finding trending products, but they aren’t your only answer. Today we’ll explain why going with products that are steady sellers can pay off in the long-term, why it can be difficult to market trending products, and why it can be tough to build a sustainable brand by focusing all your efforts into selling trending products. Ready? Let’s jump into it. Finding Trending Products Before we really dive into the pros and cons of selling trending products, it’s important that we underline how you can distinguish between a product that is trending, and a product that is a “steady seller.” There are a few different resources which you can use to find trending products, but we recommend using two main ones: Oberlo and Google Trends. Both of them are totally free and are fairly straightforward to use. If you’re thinking about selling trending products, there’s something you need to know. Those products are popular now, but it’s likely that they won’t be so popular forever. This is the same with all things which are trending – whatever goes up must come down. Sure, it’s likely that these products are going to generate revenue for your business if you can figure out how to put them in front of an audience of engaged shoppers. But it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to count on trending products to be successful for a sustained period of time. That’s exactly why it’s essential that you add some steady sellers to your store’s product list too. But how can steady sellers help with fluctuations in popularity? Well, if you can manage to market your trending products and draw in potential customers to your store, you can also highlight your steady sellers to shoppers and try to increase your average order value with upselling techniques. Also, you can use email marketing tactics to generate repeat purchases from steady sellers from customers who purchase trending products from your store. Or you could retarget your traffic with Facebook ads and promote newer trending products to shoppers who have visited your store in the past. There are a ton of options, but it’s still important that you don’t rely too much on specific trending products."

Especially when you consider that more than 200 million Instagram users actively engage with brands by visiting at least one business profile per day. Plus, Instagram is hell-bent on moving deeper into ecommerce. Whether it’s the constant Instagram Shop updates or the rumors of a standalone shopping app, it’s clear that ecommerce stores must keep up or risk being left behind. But what exactly is an Instagram Shop, how will it help you grow your business, and how can you set one up? Read on to find out. An Instagram Shop lets you integrate your product catalog with your Instagram profile. In turn, this allows you to promote your products directly to Instagram users through posts, Stories, in the Explore tab, and in a special Shop tab on your profile. Let’s look at some examples of how Instagram Shops work. The image below features watch brand MVMT and shows the Instagram Shop tab in action. This allows users visiting their profile to see all of their products without leaving the Instagram app. You can also tag Instagram Shop products in your posts in the same way you would tag a friend. This adds a little shopping bag icon to your image. Then, when users tap the photo, they can view the prices of the products featured and tap the product labels to view product pages."

  "text": "Trust is everything. Without it, people won’t even consider purchasing your products. In other words, in ecommerce, to neglect trust is to ensure failure. But here’s the problem: Trust is extremely difficult to build. And to make matters worse, it’s especially difficult to build online. Without genuine, face-to-face interaction, you must rely on your website and social media to build trust instead. So they better be good. As famed computer scientist Paul Graham said, “Overall the web is pretty sloppy, but an online store can’t afford to be.” So how can you set up your website to effectively build trust and increase sales? Here are nine strategies and tactics to start using today. Sweat the Small Stuff Ever heard the expression, “Take care of the little things and the big things will take care of themselves”? Make sure to pay close attention to the little things that erode trust, things like: Pages that load slowly Broken links Spelling errors A cluttered, messy design Unprofessional, poor quality images and graphics Confusing shipping times or prices These things may seem trivial, but they create a sense of unease, erode trust, and ultimately, hurt conversion rates. Does your website have any of these issues? Get critical and look for seemingly small problems to iron out. Better yet, ask other people with a more objective eye to point out any room for improvement. Then get to work. For instance, if your store is loading slowly, use a tool like PageSpeed Guru to increase the speed. You can also make sure your images are fully optimized and not slowing your store down by using an app like Image Optimizer. Look to improve your store’s design with an impressive Shopify theme. Next, go through each of your pages one-by-one, and click every link to make sure they all work properly. You can also use an online tool like Grammarly to highlight any errors in your text. Don’t neglect the little things. As Amazon founder Jeff Bezos said, “We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It’s our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.”"

The best niches. The best markets. By the end of this post, you’ll discover: The dropshipping niches fueling success in the markets generating the most sales. Specific products that have sold huge in different countries. Trends and patterns that you can apply to your marketing campaigns and product strategy. Some counterintuitive best-sellers that will get you thinking about how to capitalize on opportunities other store owners might be missing. Time for a trip around the globe! Before we dive in, a couple notes about the data in here. All calculations were for the calendar year of 2018 – specifically, January 1 to September 15. There are lots of product categories inside Oberlo – 24 to be exact. They range from the huge revenue-generators, like “Women’s Clothing & Accessories” and “Watches,” to slightly more obscure ones, like “Furniture” and “Weddings & Events.” Today, we’re only looking at the big boys. You’ll get plenty of context about how things compare to each other, but we won’t be getting into raw totals of orders or gross merchandise value (GMV). “GMV” refers to the total cost that Oberlo merchants paid to suppliers. The total profit on $1,000 worth of GMV could vary depending on a number of factors – pricing strategy, shipping methods, and so on. But in general, high GMV means high revenue. Global Trends We’re going to look at our Top 10 markets in just a sec, but let’s set the table by seeing how different niches stack up across the entire world: There are a couple things to take note of here, as they’ll be popping up later on, as well: Women’s Clothing & Accessories is the rockstar category. It generates the most orders and the biggest GMV for Oberlo users. Meanwhile, in a trend we’ll see on the country level, as well, Men’s Clothing & Accessories is not one of the top categories for generating orders, but is a top category when it comes to GMV. Beauty & Health is nearly always at the top of the orders list, but not the GMV list. This shows that people like buying lots of Beauty & Health products – but that those products usually don’t cost much money. Okay, so that’s how things look on the global level. Now let’s look at our Top 10 dropshipping markets."

  "text": "Ecommerce lead generation is in the same family as lead generation for finance, automotive, and [insert 20th century industry]. But lead generation for ecommerce is leaner and more agile than just about everything else we call lead generation. Wikipedia’s explainer on lead generation highlights just how much of an outlier ecommerce is compared to its predecessors: A lead is usually allotted to an individual to follow up on. Once the individual (e.g. salesperson) reviews and qualifies it to have potential business, the lead gets converted to an opportunity for a business. The opportunity then has to undergo multiple sales stages before the deal is won. Yeah, not so much for ecommerce. After all, ecommerce stores bend over backwards to avoid putting prospects through “multiple sales stages” before they convert. Chances are that your products, prices, store, and mindset are designed to trigger sales rightnow. Passing leads on to the sales team? Please. Let’s pass them on to the checkout page. This post is going to explain why lead generation for ecommerce is unique, and then look at seven tips for generating leads – and sales – for your online store. Lead generation in ecommerce is different than lead generation in other industries. For starters, the “e” in ecommerce means there probably isn’t a physical store to visit. What’s more, the deliberation involved with buying a car is much greater than the deliberation involved with, say, buying a sweater. In ecommerce, lead generation might start with a Facebook ad and end 90 seconds later on a checkout page. Before we race ahead with tips for lead generation, let’s take a moment to make sure we’re all on the same page about what a lead is. Regardless of industry, a lead is somebody who has shown an interest in your brand, products, or services. There are lots of different actions people could take to be considered a lead. A lead for the automotive industry might have played around in a virtual showroom designing their dream vehicle. Lead generation in finance might involve interacting with an online loan calculator. And of course people who visit a car dealership or bank branch could also be considered leads. There are some shared traits between the traditional concept of leads and the ecommerce concept of leads. Here’s what they have in common: 👉 Awareness is Step 1: No matter what industry you’re in, a lead has to know about you before they can become a lead. So awareness is where it all starts. Search engines, advertisements, and word of mouth might kick off this process. 👉 Leads must be convinced: Whether you sell consulting or kitchenware, there is a transition phase between lead and customer. Sometimes that transition happens in seconds, inspired by something like a discount code, and sometimes it can require weeks worth of discussions and adapted budgets. Either way, lead + eureka moment = customer. 👉 Content catalyzes this process: Content can play a vital role in generating and nurturing leads. Need to generate awareness? Well, the more content you have floating around – whether it’s blog posts, social media, YouTube videos, or something else – the better chance there is for someone to stumble across your business, no matter what your business is. And as for convincing leads to become customers, well, what better way to flex your expertise than by getting that expertise into consumable form. So yeah, there are similarities between traditional leads and ecommerce leads. But they only extend so far. After all, it’s unlikely that a car dealership would ever get a newsletter signup, shoot out a 10% off discount code via email, and close a deal later that day. But that’s exactly how it works in ecommerce, where lead generation moves at digital speeds. Visitors at your store aren’t interested in a long-term investment like someone buying themselves a car or signing up for a 15-year loan. Now let’s dig into seven tactics for ecommerce lead generation, and look at how you can turn your leads into customers."

They help in these two primary ways: Make more sales Increase the amount of money each customer spends And, let’s cut to the chase: Getting new customers is tough. It’s much easier and more cost-effective to increase the amount each customer spends with you. In fact, it’s anywhere from 5-25 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to retain an existing one. Plus, a massive 40% of an ecommerce store’s revenue is created by only 8% of its customers. That’s crazy, right? Bottom-line? If you don’t have strategies in place to increase your customer’s average order value, you’re missing out… How do you scoop up all that cash? Enter upselling and cross-selling. These proven, time-tested strategies can help you earn more money from your customers. In fact, way back in 2006, Amazon reported that 35% of its revenues were a direct result of their cross-selling and upselling efforts. Your current customers are ready to buy from you. All you have to do is give them a little nudge to increase the average order value. In this article, I’m going to show you how. You’ll learn: What upselling and cross-selling are. The subtle, but crucial differences between the two. 3 vital tips to get the most out of your upsells and cross-sells. 4 ways to massively boost sales with upselling and cross-selling. 6 tools that you can use to put these sales tactics into action. Ready? Let’s get into it. Cross-selling is a sales tactic used to generate more sales by suggesting related or complementary products to customers. As they have already committed to making a purchase, addition products are easier to promote to them. Or more simply, cross-selling can be summed up by the iconic McDonald’s phrase “Would you like fries with that?”. When cross-selling, avoid promoting products that don’t make sense or may confuse. The key is to keep it natural and relevant. For example, if you sell hair-dryers, you could cross-sell products like hair brushes, pins, or claws. And, if you sell t-shirts, you could cross-sell baseball caps, tote bags, or hoodies. Cross-selling should improve the buying experience. And, the products you cross-sell should help the customer get more value from their initial purchase. Let’s take a look at how Dollar Shave Club does it. When you add a product to your basket and head to the checkout, they present you with related products."

  "text": "Upselling is a sales technique used to persuade customers to purchase a more expensive or upgraded version of a product. If a person is already buying a product it can be easier for them to consider another, slightly different, option. Or more simply, upselling can be summed up by the McDonald’s phrase, “Would you like to supersize your order?” Remember, the aim is to deliver more value to your customers. For example, if you sell sunglasses, you could upsell sunglasses that have polarized lenses or UV protection. In this instance, your customer may not have considered protecting their eyes with polarized lenses. They could be thankful for the reminder as it’s helpful. And, given the choice, most people would prefer a premium version of your products. Let’s look at an example of upselling from Dollar Shave Club. Here, they present their products side-by-side so that buyers can compare the benefits of each. The message is clear: “Sure, you could get the inexpensive razor — it’s great. But, you can get a better razor, that provides a better shave for just a few bucks more.” And lastly, you have bundles. Bundling products together is primarily a cross-selling technique, but many bundles include upsells. Here, Dollar Shave Club present bundles of their products: Once again, the message is simple: “If you’re buying a razor, you’re going to need blades, shaving cream, and moisturizer. So, this convenient bundle not only makes your life easier, it saves you money.”"

Upselling is an important sales tactic for both of these groups as it helps your bottom line and adds value to your customers. Which is Better: Upselling or Cross-Selling? Upselling and cross-selling are obviously very similar. They both focus on providing more value to customers by prompting them to consider additional products and variations. And, in both cases, the business objective is to increase the average order value (often referred to as AOV). So, should you do both? Absolutely. You should definitely use a combination of upselling and cross-selling techniques on your dropshipping store to maximize revenue. But, it’s best to focus on upselling first. Why? Because according to data from Predictive Intent’s clients, upselling performs 20 times better than cross-selling when it comes to product pages. The graph below shows that upselling accounts for over 4% of sales, whereas cross-selling accounts for 0.2% of sales. That said, cross-selling is more effective when presented on the checkout page. In this case, data showed that cross-selling drives sales by up to 3%. Bottom-line? Start upselling first, and then add cross-selling tactics afterward. Okay, with me so far? Before discussing how to implement upselling and cross-selling tactics to boost sales, it’s important to understand four key points: Put The Customer First Upselling and cross-selling are not dirty, sleazy sales tactics. At least, they aren’t if you do them right. Let me break it down for a sec: Your business isn’t about you. Ever. It’s about providing value, and fulfilling your customers’ needs and desires — and, the most successful business people live by this. Take Jeff Bezos. He started Amazon from nothing and is now the richest man in the world. How did he do it? Bezos said, “We’ve had three big ideas at Amazon that we’ve stuck with for 18 years, and they’re the reason we’re successful: Put the customer first. Invent. Be Patient.”"

  "text": "If you’ve seen the statistics, you know that just about every trend in ecommerce is pointing up. Annual ecommerce sales are exploding each year, plus more people are more comfortable buying online than ever before – and they’re using all sorts of different devices to do it. Basically, when it comes to ecommerce, it’s rare that you find a statistic that isn’t improving year over year. Except shopping cart abandonment. Since 2006, the percentage of users who abandon their shopping carts has increased from 59.8% to 69.2% in 2017. Which isn’t a trend going in the right direction. Brick and-mortar store owners have always had to worry about whether or not buyers will ever return to their stores to buy. Fortunately in the ecommerce world, things are a bit different. Nowadays, retailers can use effective marketing techniques to show ads to users that have added products to their shopping carts, but haven’t pulled out their credit card to buy. In this post, I’m going to explain a marketing technique that we use all the time over at Conversion Hut called retargeting, which is sometimes referred to as remarketing, depending on which platform you are using. We’ll also cover seven actionable ways that you can implement for yourself. So without further ado. What Is Retargeting? Let’s imagine a user comes onto your website, browses a few pages, and then decides to go ahead and add an item to their shopping cart. Then life gets in the way and they leave your website before even entering their email address. Retargeting is the process of showing ads to these shopping cart abandoners to encourage them to come back to your website and complete their purchase. After all, not everyone is ready to buy right there and then. Some people will need more persuasion. For others, distractions simply arise and divert their attention elsewhere. One extremely important point to remember is that returning visitors will normally convert twice as often as new users. So please bear this in mind: The first goal should be to actually get them back onto your website. Different Levels of Intent Each user who visits your website will have a different level of purchase intent. Some will have their card out ready to buy, and others will just be getting started in the browsing phase. The shoppers that show the highest level of intent will be your lowest hanging fruit to begin with. These are the people who, with a gentle nudge, might be heading back to your store to complete their purchases."

  "text": "Most entrepreneurs fall into two key categories: dropshipping vs affiliate marketing. Dropshipping is when the manufacturer carries the inventory and ships it to the customer on your behalf. In dropshipping, you set your own product prices and are responsible for marketing. Similarly, in affiliate marketing, the merchant also carries inventory and ships the product. However, while you’re still responsible for marketing, you don’t get to set the product price and only receive a commission. In this article, we’ll explain the pros and cons of dropshipping and affiliate marketing to decide which is more profitable. Dropshipping Vs Affiliate Marketing: Similarities While dropshipping vs affiliate marketing have many differences, they also have quite a few similarities: Both allow you to start a business without requiring inventory or shipping goods Both are relatively low-risk business models Both have high earning potentials Both are easy to start working on immediately Both require similar skill sets such as the ability to create ads, drive traffic to a landing page and other marketing skills Both businesses can be started at a relatively low price Let’s look at the pros and cons of both starting a dropshipping and affiliate marketing business. What is Dropshipping? As a business model, dropshipping allows anyone to sell products from suppliers on their own website. There is no need to carry any inventory at all. When someone purchases a product from the dropshipper’s website, they place an order with the supplier. The supplier then packages and ships the product to the customer. Dropshipping is a great business model for a first-time ecommerce entrepreneur or people who want to test categories of products on their audience. Ecommerce entrepreneurs have even been known to run their ecommerce stores while studying, or working full-time. When running an affiliate marketing business, the costs are generally quite low. There’s usually no fee for the affiliate to pay as the merchant usually covers administrative fees on affiliate networks like Clickbank or Amazon Associates. The only costs that an affiliate typically pays for are their own website and server, which keeps costs low.
